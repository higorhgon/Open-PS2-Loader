    // beta 2257, which waited up to 15 s for the card) -- the freeze regression (2257 -> 2813,
    // ramonesfm, SCPH-30001 + Gen2) came from the busy-wait being gutted to nopdelay() (68bf1a73) AND
    // the send sitting LAST, after every card-side fd was captured against the pre-switch surface.
    // The wait has since been restored (aa780f24/847cc620, poll-first ~3 s) and the send re-landed
    // ABOVE (before any fd exists, with the fs-settle) -- the mcemu rationale only ever held when a
    // per-game VMC was configured (no VMC -> mcemu never loads and the game talks to the REAL card,
    // where the per-game folder genuinely matters: AndrewBento's logo-off report). The cross-device
    // paths (bdm/hdd/eth) send it too, with the same wait.
